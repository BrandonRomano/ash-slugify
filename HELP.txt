Usage:

    slugify $string [--quiet]
    slugify:main $string [--quiet]
        Converts any `$string` into a valid slug.

        The `$string` param will have to be quoted if there are
        spaces in the string.

        Adding the `--quiet` flag will echo only the result, and
        will not echo the logger prefix.
